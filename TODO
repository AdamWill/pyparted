- autoconf/automake the entire tree
      'make install' and make sure Python modules are installed correctly

- use disttools from Python to do as much work as possible

- new native Python classes on top of _ped (going to require a bit of
  thought to figure out what sort of API we want for the 'parted' module,
  the following are just ideas):
      Device
      Disk
      Partition
      Filesystem
      Constraint
      Label

- Walk through all of the src/py*.c files and make sure libparted exceptions
  are captured and filtered back up through Python.  Will need to define some
  sane Python exception classes for libparted's exceptions.

- Handle exceptions from libparted and pass to Python as necessary.  These
  are all of the PED_ASSERT things in libparted.

- Handle exceptions throughout the _ped module code.  Unique exceptions as
  much as possible.

- Make sure PyMemberDef, PyMethodDef, PyGetSetDef, and PyTypeObject
  structures all have docstrings:
      include/pydevice.h
      include/pydisk.h
      include/pytimer.h

- Rename modules under _ped to use all lowercase names.  Make sure all classes
  are named with studly caps (e.g., BigGiantWorthlessClass)

- Implement existing pyparted module on top of _ped, but mark it all as
  deprecated.
      class PedDevice
          get()
          open()
          close()
          sync()

          is_busy()
          geometry_new()
          constraint_any()
          disk_new_fresh()
          destroy()
      class PedDisk
          new()
          check_feature()

          set_name()
          get_name()
          is_busy()
      class PedFileSystem
          check()
          copy()
          resize()
          get_resize_constraint()
      class PedFileSystemTypeMethods
          probe_specific()
      class PedConstraint
          duplicate()

      exception_set_handler()

- Do the _ped.X() types for things like PedSector, PedUnit and other things
  where they just have the val attribute, do we need get/set methods?  I
  think so for things like bounds checking and type checking.

- Still left to implement from libparted:
  timer.h:
      py_ped_timer_new

- Figure out what, if anything, we can do with timers.  They are optional in
  libparted, but do we want to support them in pyparted?

- Error handling in the get and set methods.

- Free memory in error handling cases.

- Exception handling:
      - Audit error messages to make them more useful.

- Test cases:
    _ped.Alignment
    _ped.CHSGeometry
    _ped.Constraint
    _ped.Device
    _ped.Disk
    _ped.DiskType
    _ped.FileSystem
    _ped.FileSystemType
    _ped.Geometry
    _ped.Partition
    _ped.Timer
    _ped.unit_format_custom_byte
    _ped.unit_format_byte
    _ped.unit_format_custom
    _ped.unit_format
    _ped.unit_get_size
    _ped.unit_parse
    _ped.unit_parse_custom
    _ped.get_device
    _ped.probe_all_devices
    _ped.free_all_devices
    _ped.constraint_new_from_min_max
    _ped.constraint_new_from_min
    _ped.constraint_new_from_max
    _ped.constraint_any
    _ped.constraint_exact
    _ped.file_system_probe
    _ped.file_system_probe_specific

- The following PyTypeObjects need to be set up so that the _ped module can
  return them to callers, but users cannot instantiate them:
    _ped.Device
    _ped.CHSGeometry
    _ped.DeviceType
    _ped.DiskType
    _ped.FileSystem
    _ped.FileSystemType
    _ped.PartitionType

- Add garbage collection support code to the different PyTypeObjects.
  http://docs.python.org/c-api/gcsupport.html#supporting-cycle-detection

- Make sure this new code works in Python 3000

- Look through all PyTypeObject objects and see where we can expand
  their functionality.  Can we add str() support, for instance.

- According to the libparted code, the ped_THING_new() functions are
  convenience wrappers for the ped_THING_init() functions.  We need to
  get rid of our pass-throughs for these functions and place the call to
  ped_THING_new() inside the .tp_new function for the object:
      py_ped_partition_new()
      py_ped_timer_new()

- The git repository has a missing ref in it and it causes git-fetch to
  choke all the time.  Figure out how to remove this from the git repo.
      error: unable to find 09467a8feaa343e6ea79bdeebf3c70834d28941c
      fatal: object 09467a8feaa343e6ea79bdeebf3c70834d28941c not found

- The _destroy functions should also destroy the _ped.OBJECTS and not
  just the libparted structs.

... and much much more
