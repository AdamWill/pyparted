- autoconf/automake the entire tree
      'make install' and make sure Python modules are installed correctly

- use disttools from Python to do as much work as possible

- new native Python classes on top of _ped (going to require a bit of
  thought to figure out what sort of API we want for the 'parted' module,
  the following are just ideas):
      Device
      Disk
      Partition
      Filesystem
      Constraint
      Label

- Walk through all of the src/py*.c files and make sure libparted exceptions
  are captured and filtered back up through Python.  Will need to define some
  sane Python exception classes for libparted's exceptions.

- Handle exceptions from libparted and pass to Python as necessary.  These
  are all of the PED_ASSERT things in libparted.

- Handle exceptions throughout the _ped module code.  Unique exceptions as
  much as possible.

- Rename modules under _ped to use all lowercase names.  Make sure all classes
  are named with studly caps (e.g., BigGiantWorthlessClass)

- Implement existing pyparted module on top of _ped, but mark it all as
  deprecated.

      exception_set_handler()

- Do the _ped.X() types for things like PedSector, PedUnit and other things
  where they just have the val attribute, do we need get/set methods?  I
  think so for things like bounds checking and type checking.

- timer.h:
      py_ped_timer_new

- Make sure _ped module has Python docstrings galore

- Error handling in the get and set methods.

- When using PyArg_ParseTuple to read in strings, use "z" to account for
  None being passed in as the string (sets char * to NULL for us).

- Free memory in error handling cases.

- Exception handling:
      - Audit error messages to make them more useful.

... and much much more
