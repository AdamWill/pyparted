- autoconf/automake the entire tree
      'make maintainerclean' should work
      'make distclean' should work
      'make install'
      autogenerate the pyparted.spec example file

- new native Python classes on top of _ped
      Device
      Disk
      Partition
      Filesystem
      Constraint
      Label

- Walk through all of the src/py*.c files and make sure libparted exceptions
  are captured and filtered back up through Python.  Will need to define some
  sane Python exception classes for libparted's exceptions.

- Remove the ENUM() macro because using cpp for that stuff is annoying.  Can't
  grep!

- Implement existing pyparted module on top of _ped, but mark it all as
  deprecated.

- Handle exceptions from libparted and pass to Python as necessary.  These
  are all of the PED_ASSERT things in libparted.

- Do the _ped.X() types for things like PedSector, PedUnit and other things
  where they just have the val attribute, do we need get/set methods?  I
  think so for things like bounds checking and type checking.

- unit.h:
      py_ped_unit_parse
      py_ped_unit_parse_custom

- timer.h:
      py_ped_timer_new

- Handle exceptions throughout the _ped module code.  Unique exceptions as
  much as possible.

- Make sure _ped module has Python docstrings galore

- Add set methods for all the C primitives.

- Error handling in the get and set methods.

- More error handling and exn raising in:
      pydevice.c
      pydisk.c
      pygeom.c
      pynatmath.c
      pytimer.c

- Where integers are used as booleans, use PyBool_FromLong.

- Fill in _init methods, decide about kwargs, etc.

- Move each module's methods out of the main MethodDef in _pedmodule.c into
  the _ped_Whatever_methods lists.

... and much much more
